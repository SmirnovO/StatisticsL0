How to write a good README for your GitHub project?
Get to know why writing a good README is important, and how to improve its legibility.

It is worth or even necessary to add a README file in every new project. Today we will focus on good practices of writing such a file - with a few examples, and a ready to use template.

What is a README file?
README (as the name suggests: "read me") is the first file one should read when starting a new project. It's a set of useful information about a project, and a kind of manual. A README text file appears in many various places and refers not only to programming. We will focus on a programmer's README, though. 

Added README file on GitHub appears under the list of files in a repository. 

If we work professionally or learn coding, many times we come across the public repositories. We use the libraries made available by other developers as an open source code or we make our contribution to a project, reporting/fixing bugs, and adding new functionalities. Certainly, we use these projects because they just come in handy, and offer a high quality solution. But would we use them if they lacked a user-friendly description, that is, a good README? 

Rest assured - you will get to know the feeling of disappointment when finding a potential solution to all of your problems in a library or a project which description is poor, useless or isn't available whatsoever. 


What's the use of writing a good README?
I think you can guess it already. A good README is for others to understand what our code includes, and why it's noteworthy. A README file is also essential to retreive a project - on GitHub but also in browsers (e.g. Google). 

I am just learning so why should I be bothered about adding a README file? That code is just for me, after all, not for the whole community.

I doubt the code is just for you. And adding a README file is a good move.

README for Junior Devs
OK, now let's check why we should care for our README files since the first project!

Even if the code is just for you, possibly you will come back to it after a while. A good README enables you to relaunch a project - without wasting your time on recalling: What was it all about? 

For a budding programmer, GitHub is a calling card. The projects on GitHub are most often our portfolio. When we're at a career stage without a considerable commercial experience or nice-looking non-profit projects, a presentation of our achievements in a form of repositories is one of the best way to get visible to the recruiters. A preparation of several demonstration projects we want to show off during the interview works the best. 

If we are just learning and we drop our training projects there, let's pay attention to their good description. Even a non-technical recruiter will be able to recognize the technologies we touched, and check if it goes in line with a candidate's profile he's/she's looking for.


In Polish or in English?
Certainly, in English. Add a project description in English even if your project is in Polish language. The projects realized at the university might be treated as an exeption as they often demand a documentation in Polish. In every other case, describe your projects in English.


README.md - wait, what's it all about?
.md extension comes from a word: markdown. It's a markup language for text formatting. Maybe at first it isn't be obvious but markup has been created to make text creation easier. In HTML language, the most important heading goes with h1 tag. Similarily, we will have # before a heading in our document.

We edit .md files in any text or code editor (Notepad, Sublime, Atom, CS, etc.). 

You'll find out more on markdown usage on GitHub, and on dillinger.io you'll find an editor with a preview.


Writing a good README - newbies manual
Open a README.md. file in a new project.

Make sure the file always includes the following elements:

Titles and internal titles
Introduction - the project's aim
Technologies
Launch

Consider also using additional elements such as: 

Table of contents
Illustrations
Scope of functionalities 
Examples of use
Project status 
Sources
Other information
 

That's a lot! There's not so much to say about my project!

There is - but you're not aware of that already. 


Titles and internal titles
A title should explain clearly what we have here, and it's usually a project's name - a H1 heading prefaced with #. If a project's name doesn't disclose its content, still it's worth to suggest what it is.

Introduction
Introduction is like a summary. It shouldn't be too long as we don't want to read an essay on a project. We should describe in an interesting manner what's the project aim, and what problems does a given application solve. Two or three sentences are enough in case of a small project.

If it's a training project, mention your incentive. Why did you want to create it? To learn a particular technology? Was it a hackathon project? Was it for a non-profit organization? Is it an application created to memorize the material from workshops or and online course? It's worth mentioning here, without a doubt.


Technologies
Let's write down the languages we used, the libraries and its versions. 
For example:

Bootstrap 3 or 4
AngularJS 1.6 / Angular 2+/4/5/6
PHP 5 or 7
Python 2.7 or 3.6
Rails 4 or 5

Why? Firstly, it will be helpful when launching the project in the future. The versions of libraries change, and an inconspicuous change might cause many problems later on. It's good to know the version that has been used when our code was working exactly the way we wanted. 

Another thing: recruitment. IT recruiters browse through their candidates' GitHub accounts. Even though they lack a technical knowledge to estimate the quality of solutions, they know the keywords related to their job offers. A description of used technologies might make you stand out among other candidates. 

Let's assume there's a multitude of candidates for an internship, and a recruitment time is limited. CVs have been selected, there are two similar candidates, and a last available date in a calendar. The candidates' GitHub accounts include the same number of projects. One of them mentions the technologies in every project. A second candidate doesn't add README files or his/her projects are described poorly. What do you think, which candidate will be invited for an interview?


Launch
How to run a project? Does a project has minimum hardware requirements?

We mentioned the libraries and their versions earlier. If necessary, technologies, launch, and hardware requirements can be merged together. But if we split it into two subsections, it's worth to focus here specifically on launching a project. When we have a website or application, it can concerned setting up a local environment, a link to GitHub pages or deployed application on Heroku. Do we need input data? If so, in what format?

Let's focus on other elements that can improve our README.
